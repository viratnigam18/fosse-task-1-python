Key improvements include:
*   Modern, clean visual design using a consistent color scheme and typography.
*   Responsive layouts that adapt well to different screen sizes (mobile-first approach).
*   Improved form styling and user feedback.
*   Enhanced visual hierarchy and readability.
*   Streamlined navigation.

## Setup Instructions

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/viratnigam18/fosse-task-1-python/tree/main
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd fossee-workshop-booking
    ```
3.  (Assuming it's a Django project based on previous conversation) Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  Apply database migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
6.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
7.  Access the application in your web browser (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

## Design Principles

*   **Mobile-First:** The design prioritizes the experience on mobile devices, ensuring usability on smaller screens.
*   **Clarity and Hierarchy:** Visual elements are organized to guide the user's attention effectively using spacing, font sizes, and contrast.
*   **Consistency:** A unified design language is applied across all pages, including colors, buttons, and form elements.
*   **Simplicity:** The interface avoids unnecessary clutter, focusing on essential elements for core tasks.

## Responsiveness

Responsiveness was achieved using:
*   Flexible CSS layouts (Flexbox).
*   Media queries to adjust styles for different screen widths.
*   Appropriate sizing for touch targets on mobile devices.

## Trade-offs

*   **Design vs. Performance:** While adding visual enhancements, care was taken to use efficient CSS and avoid heavy assets or libraries that could significantly impact load times. The focus was on clean, lightweight styling.
*   **Feature Scope:** The enhancements focused on UI/UX improvements rather than adding new functional features, keeping changes manageable and focused.

## Challenges

*   **Balancing Aesthetics and Functionality:** Ensuring the new design looked modern while remaining intuitive and functional for users was a key challenge. This was addressed through iterative design and testing.
*   **Maintaining Compatibility:** Integrating new styles and layouts without breaking existing Django templates and form functionalities required careful attention to CSS specificity and structure.
